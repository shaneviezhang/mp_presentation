## Introduction
&lt;font size="4"&gt;
Plastic has gained exponential popularity since its invention in the 1900s.

- Annual plastics production hit &lt;span style="color:skyblue"&gt;400 million&lt;/span&gt; tons in 2022, with 40% used in packaging (Geyer, Jambeck, and Law, 2017).

- Unlike organic materials, plastics do not decompose but instead break down into increasingly smaller fragments.

- 80% of plastic waste accumulates in landfills or the environment.

- Between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tons of plastic waste enter rivers and oceans annually (Jambeck et al., 2015).

&lt;br/&gt;

## Introduction
&lt;font size="4"&gt;
Data on the health effects of microplastics remains scarce (Lim, 2021).

We present the first global estimate of microplastic exposure's impact on infant health.

- Innovations in our approach include:

 - **New Measurement Technique**: space radar-based remote sensing to detect ocean surface microplastics by observing changes in surface roughness due to wind.

 - **Oceanic Transport Model**: day-to-day ocean current variability to predict microplastic movement from open seas to coasts, clarifying causal impacts.

 - **Data Integration**: microplastic data with birth records from 3 million infants across 15 countries and four continents.





---

## Results Preview
&lt;font size="4"&gt;
  
We find robust evidence that in-utero exposure to microplastics significantly increases the likelihood of low birth weight (LBW) among mothers who lived within 200 km of the coastal line.


 - Each doubling of microplastic concentration during pregnancy increases LBW incidents by **3.7 per 1,000 births**.  - This effect is primarily driven by exposure during the second and third trimesters.
 
 - No impact of microplastic exposure during the preconception and postpartum periods. 
 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

The effect size we find is significant, suggesting that microplastic variability accounts for about **2** percent of all low birth weight births. This rate ranges from approximately **1.2** percent in the USA to over **8** percent in certain developing countries in Africa and South Asia.

 - Scaled linearly, our estimate implies that about **205,800** of LBW coastal births annually worldwide can be attributed to microplastic exposure.

## Results Preview

Mechanisms Linking Microplastics and Infant Health

- Pathways: Water and Air

 - **Water**: microplastics accumulate in water bodies and enter diets via contaminated seafood.
 
No statistically significant evidence that areas with higher seafood access are associated with a larger health effect

-  

 - **Air**: variations in microplastic levels strongly predict the concentration of coastal aerosol particulate pollution, as measured by an independent satellite instrument. 
 
This relationship intensifies with higher rates of evaporation in coastal regions.
 
---

## Contribution

- To our knowledge, this paper is the **first** to establish a direct link between ambient microplastic exposure and health using large-scale data.

- Our findings on microplastic aerosolization highlights a new, pervasive source of airborne particulate pollution and raise important questions about their broader impacts. 

- From a policy perspective, our research emphasizes the natures in which microplastic pollution is a global challenge.

## Current Knowledge
&lt;font size="4"&gt;
**Emission Sources**: Oceans MPs stem from both land-based (80%) and ocean-based (20%) activities.

&lt;span style="color:skyblue"&gt;Redford et al., 1997; Browne et al., 2010; Cole et al., 2011; Good et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016; Eriksen et al., 2014; Jambeck et al., 2015; Van Sebille et al., 2015; Worm et al., 2017.&lt;/span&gt;


**Ambient Presence**：MPs have been detected in water, soil, and air, reflecting widespread environmental dispersion.

&lt;span style="color:skyblue"&gt;Cauwenberghe et al., 2013; Cole et al., 2011; Cozar et al., 2014; Free et al., 2014; Rilling et al., 2012; Lwanga et al., 2016; Prata, 2018; Rodrigues et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Lehmann et al., 2021; Herb et al., 2023; Allen et al., 2020; Caracci et al., 2023.&lt;/span&gt;

**Environmental Exposure**：MPs pose significant threats to both terrestrial and marine organisms.

&lt;span style="color:skyblue"&gt;Derraik, 2002; Ryan et al., 2009; Lozano and Mouat, 2009; van Franeker et al., 2011; Cole et al., 2011, 2013; Schuyler et al., 2014; Trevail et al., 2015; Avio et al., 2015; Carbery et al., 2018; Machado et al., 2019.&lt;/span&gt;
---

## Current Knowledge
&lt;font size="4"&gt;
Health Effects： Existing evidence showing the direct health consequences of MP exposure is very limited.

&lt;span style="color:skyblue"&gt;Yan et al. 2022; Baeza and Martinez 2022; Amereh et al. 2022.&lt;/span&gt;


In contrast, a larger number of papers have documented the risks of MP exposure by identifying MPs in food, water, and the environment without directly measuring health outcomes. 


- MPs have been found in various marine species and seafood across different regions, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, Mexico, Italy, Montenegro, Portugal, and Atlantic Ocean.

&lt;span style="color:skyblue"&gt;Fang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2022; Lam et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021; Akkajit et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021; Selvam et al., 2021; Luqman et al., 2021;  Akhbarizadeh et al., 2019;  Mahu et al., 2023;  Martinez-Tavera et al., 2021; Squillante et al., 2023;  Boskovic et al., 2023; Barboza et al., 2020.&lt;/span&gt;


- MPs have also been detected in water bodies, air, and human tissues.

&lt;span style="color:skyblue"&gt;Liao et al., 2020; Khaleel et al., 2023; Wright et al., 2020; Dehghani et al., 2017; Amato-Lourenco at al. (2021); Huang et al. (2022).&lt;/span&gt;

**Direct effects on human health or respiratory malfunctions were not confirmed.**

## Data Sources: Atmospheric and Channels

&lt;font size="4"&gt; 

**Atmospheric Conditions**: Air pollution data from MERRA2---aerosol optical depth (AOD); depicts the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere. 

**Evaporation**: NCEP/DOE (National Center for Atmospheric Research/Department of Energy) Reanalysis II product. 

**meteorological condition**: Temperature and precipitation data form the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) products.

**Seafood Access**:
- Seafood consumption data in the US is sourced from the Nielsen consumer panel, which consists of a representative panel of households continuously providing information about their purchases in a longitudinal study.

- Fishery effort data is obtained from Global Fishing Watch.

## Econometric Setup
Our goal is to estimate the causal impact of microplastic exposure while in utero on birth outcome. The workhorce econometric equation is as follows:

$$
`\begin{align*}
\text{Low Birth Weight}_{i,c,t} = \beta \cdot \log \left( \sum_{k=1}^9 \text{Microplastics}_{c,t+k} \right) + \alpha_c + \alpha_t + X_{c,t} + \gamma + \epsilon_{ict}
\end{align*}`
$$
&lt;font size="4"&gt; 
- `\(\text{Low Birth Weight}_{i,c,t}\)` is an indicator variable for whether birth  occurring in region  at month  is weighing less than 2,500 grams. 

- `\(\sum_{k=1}^9 \text{Microplastics}_{c,t+k}\)` captures i’s exposure to microplastics while in utero, which equals the logged sum of microplastic levels observed at th nearest coastal sea grid to location  over the 9-month period preceding i’s birth.

- `\(X_{c,t}\)` time-varying environmental covariates, including tempetarure, precipitation, aerosol pollution, and ocean chlorophyll-a (ocean water pollution)

- `\(\alpha_c\)` are region (admin1) fixed effects

- `\(\alpha_t\)` are country by month-of-sample fixed effects 
---

## Econometric Challenge

&lt;font size="4"&gt; 

Challenge: Potential endogeneity from third factors affecting birth outcomes, not accounted for by fixed effects and co-pollutant controls.

- We address these concerns in several ways.

 - **Alternative Exposure Measures**: Using alternative in-utero microplastic exposure to leverage the quasi-random variation that comes from ocean dynamics.
 
 
 - Ocean Current Dynamic Model: Computes predicted coastal microplastic concentrations from microplastics transported from areas at least 200 km from the coast.Incorporates observed concentrations and ocean currents data to simulate how far-sea microplastics migrate towards coastal zones.
 
 - The source of variation—microplastic variation far from land and changes in ocean currents—should have little to do with coastal birth weights except through their influence on coastal microplastic variability.


---


## Microplastic Transport Modeling

&lt;font size="4"&gt; 

**Exogenous Exposure Measure**: Develop a measure of microplastic exposure from deep sea areas to coastal regions, minimizing correlation with coastal activities.

- **Ocean Current Flow Intensity Matrix**: Applies an oceanography model to quantify the flow of microplastics based on ocean current dynamics.

- **Variable Definition**: `\( MP_{i \rightarrow r, m} \)` represents the intensity of microplastics transported from a sender grid to a receiver coastal grid during a specific month.

Spatial Representation of Current Flows: Generate maps from individual current vectors by following the daily speed and direction, creating streamlines that represent the trajectory of ocean currents.

Deep Sea Senders Identification: Define sender grids based on their distance from coastal areas, using 200 km as the cutoff.

---

## Microplastic Transport Modeling

&lt;font size="4"&gt;

Downstream Intensity Score: Establish a scoring system to measure the intensity of microplastics transported from each sender to coastal receivers.

$$
`\begin{align*}
\text{Current}_{i,r,d,t} = \exp \left( -\alpha \cdot \text{rad}_{i,r,d,t} - \beta \cdot | \theta |_{i \rightarrow r,d,t} - \gamma \cdot \text{dist}_{i,r,d,t} \right)
\end{align*}`
$$
$$
`\begin{align*}
\text{Current}_{i,r,d'} = \sum_{d+t=d'} \text{Current}_{i,r,d,t}
\end{align*}`
$$

# Econometric Setup
Second, we estimate an augmented version of equation (1) by replacing the in-utero, 9-month microplastic exposure with separate trimester exposure terms. These trimester terms provide additional information on which trimester exposure seems to matter the most, in a way that we can compare to the medical literature.

We further add a “preconception” and a “postpartum” term, measuring microplastic “exposure” in the 3 months prior to conception and 3 months after birth. These “placebo” effect terms provide a chance to test for model misspecification. The augmented estimation equation is as follows:

$$
`\begin{align*}
\text{Low Birth Weight}_{i,c,t} &amp;= \beta_{\text{Preconception}} \cdot \log \left( \sum_{k=-10}^{-12} \text{Microplastics}_{c,t+k} \right) \\
&amp;\quad + \beta_{\text{1st Trimester}} \cdot \log \left( \sum_{k=-7}^{-9} \text{Microplastics}_{c,t+k} \right) \\
&amp;\quad + \beta_{\text{2nd Trimester}} \cdot \log \left( \sum_{k=-4}^{-6} \text{Microplastics}_{c,t+k} \right) \\
&amp;\quad + \beta_{\text{3rd Trimester}} \cdot \log \left( \sum_{k=-1}^{-3} \text{Microplastics}_{c,t+k} \right) \\
&amp;\quad + \beta_{\text{Postpartum}} \cdot \log \left( \sum_{k=0}^{2} \text{Microplastics}_{c,t+k} \right) \\
&amp;\quad + \alpha_c + \alpha_t + X_{c,t} + \gamma + \epsilon_{ict}
\end{align*}`
$$

# Econometric Setup

Third, our estimation sample contains data from multiple countries spanning different parts of the world. This means the characteristics of microplastic fluctuations vary significantly across locations in our sample (Figure xx), as do other environmental and economic conditions.

## Main Results

## Channels
How does in-utero exposure to microplastics cause low birth weight? 


- Access to Seafood： The first obvious channel is seafood consumption. Microplastics deposit in sea animals and accumulate as they move up the food chain, ultimately entering the human system as seafood is consumed. One intuitive test of this channel is to see whether the impact of microplastics on low birth weight is higher in areas with a higher rate of seafood consumption. 
 - county-level seafood spending per capita
 - an area’s 2017-2018 average fishing hours as a proxy for access to seafood



- Aerosolization： Due to their small sizes, many microplastic species may become airborne under suitable atmospheric conditions. Aerosolized microplastics may thus become inhalable and enter the human system through respiratory tracts and, like fine particulate matter, penetrate human organs.

## Conclusion

Decades of academic and policy debate have been paid to the issue of plastic pollution but there is a paucity of direct evidence on its health effects. Growing availability of high-resolution measurements of microplastics, oceanic motion, and health, as well as methods that are able to identify causal signals in these data, may help close this gap. Our initial look into this question in infant health setting suggests microplastics exposure may indeed have important health ramifications as science from multiple fields has warned.
